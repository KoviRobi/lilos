//! A queue for moving data from one future/task into another.
//!
//! This is a "single-producer, single-consumer" queue that splits into separate
//! `Push` and `Pop` endpoints -- at any given time, there is at most one of
//! each alive in your program, ensuring that pushes and pops are not coming
//! from multiple directions.
//!
//! You create a queue by calling `Queue::new` and passing it a reference to its
//! backing storage. To actually use the queue, however, you must call
//! `Queue::split` to break it into two endpoints, `Push` and `Pop`. As their
//! names suggest, `Push` can be used to push things into the queue, and `Pop`
//! can be used to pop things out of it.
//!
//! The `Push` and `Pop` can then be handed off to separate code paths, so long
//! as they don't outlive the `Queue` and its storage.
//!
//! This queue uses the Rust type system to ensure that only one code path is
//! attempting to push or pop the queue at any given time, because both `Push`
//! and `Pop` endpoints borrow the central `Queue`, and an `async` operation to
//! push or pop through an endpoint borrows that endpoint in turn.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! This is implemented as a concurrent lock-free Lamport queue. This has two
//! implications:
//! 
//! 1. If you can arrange the lifetimes correctly (i.e. make the queue static)
//!    it is actually safe to operate either Push or Pop from an ISR.
//! 2. It fills up at N-1 elements because one empty slot is used as a sentinel
//!    to distinguish full from empty.
//!
//! The adaptations to modern memory ordering semantics are taken from Nhat Minh
//! LÃª et al's paper "Correct and Efficient Bounded FIFO Queues," though this
//! implementation does not use _all_ of the optimizations they identified.
